## Project description

Banks store vast amounts of information about their customers. This data can be used to stay in touch with customers and target them individually to products or banking offers that are right for them.<br>
Usually, selected customers are contacted directly through various communication channels: in person (for example, when visiting a bank), by phone, by e-mail, in instant messengers, and so on. This type of marketing is called direct marketing. In fact, direct marketing is used to interact with customers in most banks and insurance companies. But, of course, running marketing campaigns and interacting with customers is labor intensive and expensive.<br>
Banks would like to be able to choose among their customers exactly those who are most likely to take advantage of a particular offer, and contact them.

##  Conditions of the competition and criteria for assessment
**Conditions**
1. This competition is timeless and accessible for all educational streams.
2. Deadline is set for each educational stream.
3. Test sample is fully represented in LeaderBoard.
4. Make real ML product, which could be used on new data further.

**Criteria**
1. Quality of code (compliance with PEP-8, comments for code, README for project). 
2. Shaping the project on one of the platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Kaggle.
3. Data cleaning.
4. Data study (quality of visiualisation, new ideas, hypothesis, comments).
5. Feature engeneering.
6. Feature selecting.
7. Feature transformation.

Metric for assessment of the implementation: **MAPE(Mean Absolute Precentage of Error)**
