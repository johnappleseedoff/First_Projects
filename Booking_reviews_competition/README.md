## Project description

The issue is that dishonest hotels boost their scores.
One of the methods to find such hotels is to construct a model, which would predict a score of hotel.
If predicted scores would much differ from scores on platform, it would probably mean that the score has been boosted and it must be checked.

## Case to solve

**Business task:** help company to determine dishonest hotels and make platform more effective<br>
**Technical challenge:** build a machine learning model that will predict hotel score by proposed features

##  Conditions of the competition and criteria for assessment
**Conditions**
1. This competition is timeless and accessible for all educational streams.
2. Deadline is set for each educational stream.
3. Test sample is fully represented in LeaderBoard.
4. Make real ML product, which could be used on new data further.

**Criteria**
1. Quality of code (compliance with PEP-8, comments for code, README for project). 
2. Shaping the project on one of the platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Kaggle.
3. Data cleaning.
4. Data study (quality of visiualisation, new ideas, hypothesis, comments).
5. Feature engeneering.
6. Feature selecting.
7. Feature transformation.

Metric for assessment of the implementation: **MAPE(Mean Absolute Precentage of Error)**
