### Case to solve    
Part of applicants do not indicate the desired salary when preparing their resume. This is a problem for the HeadHunter recommendatory system, which selects a list of the most suitable vacancies for applicants, and a list of most suitable professionals for employers. HeadHunter company wants to train a model, which would automatically determine the approximate wage level, suitable for applicant, using the information, which he indicated about himself. It is necessary to transform, analyze and clean data in the dataset for model training.


### Conditions of the competition and criteria for assessment 
**Conditions**
- Look closely at the details of the task.
- Download already known dataset and notebook template.
- Be sure to familiarize with additional theoretical material, which is given before the task.
- Take advantage of advices and hints from the training platform in the execution of the project.
- Answer all control questions: you can get a maximum of 30 points.
- Download your customized as required jupyter notebook with solution on GitHub.
- Pass the project for verification and receive 10 points (of which 8 points for the main task and 2 points for the additional) for the conclusions on Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Get feedback from the course team.
- **For the successful passing of the project it is necessary to score 21 out of 40 possible.**

**Criteria**     
- The solution is only available in Jupyter Notebook.
- Solution is processed according to the jupyter notebook template.
- Each task must be executed in a separate specially selected cell(in the template they are marked as your code here). You should not create many cells to solve the task, this creates inconvenience when checking.
- The code for each task is drawn up in one or two jupyter cells (it is not necessary to create many cells to solve the task, this creates inconvenience when checking).
- You must use only passed materilas for solution: variables, basic data structure (lists, dictionaries, sets), cycles, fuctions, libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly. If you think you need to use third-party libraries or tools to solve (for example Excel), other programming languages or unexplored constructions, you are mistaken :) All tasks are solved using already familiar methods.
- The code must be readable and understandable: Names of variables and functions reflect their essence, it is important to avoid multiline constructions and conditions.
- Use PEP 8 guidance.
- Graphics are drawn according to the rules we have given in the data visualization module.
- Mandatory requirement: graphics should contain a name reflecting their essence and signatures of axes.
- Conclusions to chats are in Markdown format under the chart in a separate cell (in the template they are marked as your conclusions here). The conclusions should be presented as small linked sentences in Russian.
