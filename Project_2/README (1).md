## Project description

Continue education in SkillFactory platform. Project 2 is for consolidation of knowledge in Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)


## Case to solve

Imagine, that you work as datascientist in Booking Company. 
The issue is that dishonest hotels boost their scores.
One of the methods to find such hotels is to construct a model, which would predict a score of hotel.
If predicted scores would much differ from scores on platform, it would probably mean that score has been boosted and it must be checked.
##  Conditions of the competition

1. This competition is timeless and accessible for all educational streams.

2. Deadline is set for each educational stream.

3. Test sample is fully represented in LeaderBoard.

4. Make real ML product, which could be used on new data further.

## Metric

For assessment of the implementation:

**MAPE(Mean Absolute Precentage of Error)**
## Skills to practice in
